# lancer-reference

This is supposed to be a reference of most of the rules of lancer, put into useful chunks and with hyperlinks inbetween so you can finally jump to the quick tech list when you need it. (not gear, that stuff is already pretty well documented in [comp-con](https://massif-press.itch.io/compcon))

Lancer is a mech space TTRPG you can get here <https://massif-press.itch.io/corebook-pdf>


Of what exists the most relevant jumping off point right now is probably the [combat action reference](/combat/action-reference.md)
