### Limitations
- Characters can’t take the same action more than once in a turn, except as free actions or reactions.
- Characters may take any number of free actions.
- Characters can take one reaction per each characters turn (their turn or that of another character).
- Characters may OVERCHARGE to make an extra quick action as a free action at the cost of heat.

## Standard Movement
- Move up to your Speed in any direction
  - You can freely split up your move before/after/inbetween actions, but you cant move within an action (so no movement between 2 actions of a BARRAGE).
  - If your character moves adjacent to a hostile haracter, they become ENGAGED. If that character is the same SIZE or larger than them, they must stop moving.
  - Your character can freely move through allied characters, and smaller hostile characters or objects. Other characters and objects are obstructions, which block movement.
  - If you are engaged (next to) another character and *begin* a move you typically trigger an OVERWATCH reaction and they get to attack you.

## Quick Actions
- SKIRMISH: Attack with one weapon. (you can only skirmish once per round as stated above, but you can also BARRAGE with 2 different weapons which is similar)
- BOOST: Move spaces equal to your SPEED.
- RAM: Attempt to knock a target down or back.
- GRAPPLE: Attempt to grab a target, potentially IMMOBILIZING or riding them.
- [QUICK TECH](/combat/tech.md#quick-tech): Perform quick electronic warfare or system-boosting activities. 
  - (unlike all other actions, you can quick tech multiple times per round as long as you use different options)
- HIDE: Attempt to hide.
- SEARCH: Look for a HIDDEN target.

## Full Actions
- BARRAGE: Attack with two different weapons or a single SUPERHEAVY weapon.
- [FULL TECH](/combat/tech.md#full-tech): Perform two [QUICK TECH](/combat/tech.md#quick-tech) actions or one more complex tech action.
  - doing two [QUICK TECH](/combat/tech.md#quick-tech) actions via this allows you to use the same option twice.
- IMPROVISED ATTACK: Attack with a fist or improvised melee weapon.
- STABILIZE: Reload, patch up, and cool down a mech, or end conditions affecting it.
- DISENGAGE: Move safely, avoiding reactions and engagement.

## Other Actions
- ACTIVATE (quick or full): Activate a system or piece of gear. (details should be described with the system/gear)

- PREPARE (quick): Hold a quick action for a pecified trigger.

## [Reactions](/combat/reactions.md)
  - Each reaction can only be taken once between your own turns and you can only take one reaction per one characters turn.
- [BRACE](/combat/reactions.md#BRACE): Get ready for impact, reducing damage at the cost of next turn’s actions.
- [OVERWATCH](/combat/reactions.md#OVERWATCH): Attack a nearby target if they attempt to move.

## Overcharge
- Push a mech past its limits, gaining an extra quick action as a FREE ACTION at the cost of heat.
- Heat taken: 1, 1d3, 1d6, then 1d6+4 according to uses since last Full Repair.

## Pilot Actions
- If you're outside of your mech you get most of the same actions(move + \[quick + quick\] or full + free actions) as inside a mech.
- With your actions you can BOOST, HIDE, SEARCH, ACTIVATE, SKILL CHECK, DISENGAGE, PREPARE, MOUNT and OVERWATCH.
- Additionally you can:
- FIGHT (full or quick): Attack with one weapon (used instead of SKIRMISH when Pilots OVERWATCH). Full action unless stated otherwise (usually by the SIDEARM weapon tag).
- JOCKEY (full): Attempt to climb and attack a mech.
