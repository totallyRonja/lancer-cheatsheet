Reactions are special actions that can be taken out of turn order in response to certain triggers, such as enemy attacks or movement. Unless specified otherwise, once you take a reaction you cannot take it again until the beginning of your next turn. Even if a reaction is usable 2/round or more, your uses of it only refresh when your next turn begins. 

You can only take one reaction per turn ‚Äì your turn or other characters‚Äô turns ‚Äì but you can take any number of reactions per round, as long as you have reactions still available.

So you can both [BRACE](#BRACE) and [OVERWATCH](#OVERWATCH) between your turns, but you can't BRACE on an opponents turn in which you already used OVERWATCH and you can't BRACE or OVERWATCH twice between your turns.

By default, all mechs can take the BRACE and OVERWATCH reactions. Certain systems, weapons and talents can grant other reactions.

## Brace
When you BRACE, you ready your mech against incoming fire.
- Trigger: You are hit by an attack and damage has been rolled.
- Effect: You count as having RESISTANCE to all damage, üî•, and üå° from the triggering attack, and until the end of your next turn, all other attacks against you are made at +1‚ûñ. <br/>
Due to the stress of bracing, you cannot take reactions until the end of your next turn and on that turn, you can only take one quick action ‚Äì you cannot OVERCHARGE, move normally, take full actions, or take free actions.

## Overwatch
When you OVERWATCH, you control and defend the space around your mech from enemy incursion through pilot skill, reflexes, or finely tuned subsystems.

Unless specified otherwise, all weapons default to 1 THREAT‚ùå.
- Trigger: A hostile character starts any movement (including BOOST and other actions) inside one of your weapons‚Äô THREAT‚ùå.
- Effect: Trigger OVERWATCH, immediately using that weapon to SKIRMISH against that character as a reaction, before they move.
