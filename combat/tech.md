When you use TECH, you engage in electronic warfare, countermeasures, and other technical actions, often aided by a mechâ€™s powerful computing and simulation cores.

Each time you take this action, you choose an option from the QUICK TECH list. All mechs have access to these options, but some systems enhance them or make new options available.

## Quick Tech
Unlike other quick actions, QUICK TECH can be taken more than once per turn; however, a different option must be chosen every time, unless specified otherwise or granted as a free action.

To use QUICK TECH, choose one of the following options:

- ### Bolster
  - When you BOLSTER, you use your mechâ€™s formidable processing power to enhance another characterâ€™s systems.
  - To BOLSTER, choose a character within SENSORS. They receive +2ô€€œ on the next skill check or save they make between now and the end of their next turn. Characters can only benefit from one BOLSTER at a time
- ### Scan
  - When you SCAN, you use your mechâ€™s powerful sensors to perform a deep scan on an enemy.
<br>To SCAN, choose a character or object within SENSORS and line of sight, then ask the GM for one of the following pieces of information, which they must answer honestly:
    - Your targetâ€™s weapons, systems, and full statistics (HP, SPEED, EVASION, ARMOR, MECH SKILLS, and so on).
    - One piece of hidden information about the target, such as confidential cargo or data, current mission, the identity of the pilot, and so on.
    - Generic or public information about the target that can be pulled from an info bank or records, such as the model number of a mech.
  - Any information gathered is only current at the time of the SCAN â€“ if the target later takes damage, for instance, you donâ€™t receive an update.
- ### Lock On
  - When you LOCK ON, you digitally mark a target, lighting them up for your teammatesâ€™ targeting systems and exposing weak points.
<br> To LOCK ON, choose a character within SENSORS and line of sight. They gain the LOCK ON condition.
<br> Any character making an attack against a character with LOCK ON may choose to gain +1âž• on that attack and then clear the LOCK ON condition after that attack resolves. This is called consuming LOCK ON.
- ### Invade
  - When you INVADE, you mount a direct electronic attack against a target. To INVADE, make a [TECH ATTACK](#tech-attack) against a character within SENSORS and line of sight.
<br>On a success, your target takes 2ðŸŒ¡ and you choose one of the INVASION options available to you.
<br>FRAGMENT SIGNAL is available to all characters, and additional options are granted by certain systems and equipment with the INVADE tag.
  - #### FRAGMENT SIGNAL
    - You feed false information, obscene messages, or phantom signals to your targetâ€™s computing core. They become IMPAIRED and SLOWED until the end of their next turn
  - You can also INVADE willing allied characters to create certain effects. If your target is willing and allied, you are automatically successful, it doesnâ€™t count as an attack, and your target doesnâ€™t take any heat.

## Full Tech
When you use FULL TECH, you perform multiple tech actions or a single, more complex action.

To use FULL TECH, choose two [QUICK TECH](#QUICK-TECH) options or a single system or tech option that requires FULL TECH to activate. If you choose two QUICK TECH options, you **can** choose the same option multiple times.

## Tech Attack
Not all tech actions are tech attacks, only when you make a tech attack roll against e-defense it counts as tech attack for triggers and other effects (so most of the time [INVADE](#invade) tech actions).
